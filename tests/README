The script test.sh runs a few tests. For the script to work, a debug build of
the preprocessor has to be available in the build directory and the following
binaries have to be available:
  clasp          - clasp version >= 3.0
  gringo-4       - gingo version >= 4.2.1
  cudf-sol-check - latest version available at [1]

Pathes can easily be changed in the script file.
